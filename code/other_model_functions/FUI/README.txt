This folder contains the R code for model implementation, simulation and application.

lfosrsim.R: simulate a dataset containing longitudinal functional outcomes and a scalar predictor.

lfosr3s.R: fit longitudinal function-on-scalar regression model using FUI.

simulation.R: comparison of FUI and FAMM using simulated data.

application_DTI.R: implement FUI in the DTI study (data not shown due to restricted use).

application_NHANES_fit.R: implement FUI in the NHANES study (bootstrap not shown).

application_NHANES_plot.R: make Figure 6 of the paper if the bootstrap results of NHANES are available.

jointCB.R: comparison of the computing time of two methods to obtain joint confidence bands (discussed in the supplementary material).
